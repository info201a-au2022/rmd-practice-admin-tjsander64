## Covid Report
The US is currently in a minor upswing of COVID cases, as mask mandates relax and people begin to cluster together for the winter months; the current number of recorded COVID cases in the us is: `r get_total_cases()`. The current US death count is `r get_total_deaths()`. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
